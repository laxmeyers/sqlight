# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}
This software lets you add students and classes and then give students grades in classes.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote this software to improve my skills with SQL and know how I can apply it in one of my programs using python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

{Describe the relational database you are using.}
I am using SQLite3
{Describe the structure (tables) of the relational database that you created.}
I am using a SQL database that holds students in one table classes in another and then lastly grades with the student and class.
# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used visual studio Code to help write everything for the application.
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used python with SQLite3. This is kinda like mixing MySQL with python to be able to add and interact with the database easily in one application.
